EXPERIENCE/ WORK EXPERIENCE
Growth Grids Pvt. Ltd. – India
Python Developer Intern – CV Parser Project Jun 2025 – Jul 2025

Developed an advanced CV parser using chunking techniques with custom regular expressions,as a RAG approach to increasing
extraction accuracy across diverse resume formats

Integrated LLama-based large language model (LLM) to semantically label and classify text chunks, improving section detection in
unstructured resumes by 60%

Designed a hybrid pipeline that combined rule-based and AI-driven logic for extracting sections like
Education, Experience, and Skills

Automated resume parsing from .pdf, .docx, and scanned .jpg formats using OCR (Tesseract) and
PyMuPDF, reducing manual effort by 70%

Validation & Error Handling: Ensuring extracted data is correct through structured testing methods.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Implementing spaCy or transformers to detect names, skill s, experience, and education.

Regex & Pattern Matching: Using custom regex to extract structured sections (e.g., "Name:", "Education:", "Experience:").
